# Hardware Tinker

My name is Steve, and HardwareTinker.com is just a place for me to show my tinkering.  I'm certainly not the world's best overclocker, system builder, or elite gamer, and I am certainly not manufacturer or vendor sponsored to show off the latest greatest hardware, but I try to do cool things that the average enthusiast can replicate at home.  I focus on the basics that many big tech guys just gloss over, assuming that everyone knows the details.  I hope you like the site and I am always open to feedback at my [Hardware Tinker G-mail][0] or on my [Facebook page][1].
